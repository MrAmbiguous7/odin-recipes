        <p>
            This recipe uses firm tofu instead of cheese for lasagna which tends to have a lot of animal product in it.
            It is the same in many ways, however, to regular lasagna recipes, using tomatoes and tomato paste in between finely
            cooked noodles to form a neat stack of yummy goodness.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp minced Garlic</li>
            <li>4 cans tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/3 cup tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 16 oz package of lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>2 pounds firm tofu</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley</li>
            <li>3 10 oz packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the sauce: In a large, heavy saucepan, over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Place the onions in the saucepan
                 and saute them until they are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic; cook 5 minutes more. </li>
            <li>Place the tomatoes, tomato paste, basil and parsley in the saucepan. Stir will, turn the heat to low and let
                the sauce simmer covered for 1 hour. Add the salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is cooking bring a large kettle of salted water to a boil. Boil the lasagna noodles for 9
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Place the tofu blocks in a large bowl. Add the garlic, basil, and parsley. Add the salt and pepper, and mash
            all the ingredients together by squeezing pieces of tofu through your fingers. Mix well</li>                
            <li>Assemble the lasagna: Spread 1 cup of the tomato sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch casserole pan. Arrange a 
                single layer of lasagna noodles, sprinkle one-third of the tofu mixture over the noodles. Distribute the spinach
                evenly over the tofu. Next ladle 1 1/2 cups tomato sauce over the tofu, and top it with another layer of the
                noodles. Then sprinkle another 1/3 of the tofu mixture over the noodles, top the tofu with 1 1/2 cups tomato 
                sauce, and place a final layer of noodles over the tomato sauce. Finally, top the noodles with the final 1/3 of 
                the tofu, and spread the remaining tomato sauce over everything. </li>
            <li>Cover the pan with foil and bake the lasagna for 30 minutes. Serve hot and enjoy</li>
        </ol>
