            This recipe uses firm tofu instead of cheese for lasagna which tends to have a lot of animal product in it.
            It is the same in many ways, however, to regular lasagna recipes, using tomatoes and tomato paste in between finely
            cooked noodles to form a neat stack of yummy goodness.
